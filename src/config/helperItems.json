South East Asia Vaccinations:
  I receive immunization questions all the time from clients. Personally, I believe in getting the minimum recommended or required by the country being visited. Most people hate shots and they are/have become a rather expensive part of trip preparations. Most of my treks are in the Himalayan countries of South Asia.
  Minimum vaccinations I recommend to my clients traveling are:

  Adult polio booster
  Tetanus / diphtheria
  Hepatitis A
  Typhoid
  Yellow Fever (required for all South America trips)
  Malaria medication only if visiting the jungle areas of these countries.
